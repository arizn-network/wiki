# Parity Signer Mobile App

## What is it ?
Parity Signer Mobile App is a secure air-gapped wallet that allows users to use a smartphone as cold storage. It means that, once the the app has been installed, users can create Ethereum accounts, sign transactions and [transfer funds](Parity-Signer-Mobile-App-MyCrypto-tutorial) from and to these accounts without any sort of connectivity enabled on the device. Wifi, Mobile Network, Bluetooth can be shutdown and even removed physically to ensure that the mobile phone containing these accounts will not be exposed to any online threat.

To achieve this, any data transfer to or from the app will happen using QR code scanning. By doing so, the most sensitive piece of information, the private key, will never leave the phone. The Parity Signer App can be used to store any Ethereum Account, this includes ETH, ETC as well as Ether from various testnets (Kovan, Ropsten...).
